Welcome to the SELL&BUY website code files :)

This is a site for buying and selling second hand products.

There are a variety of products that are arranged by different categories and you can even filter the content by price.

A user who logs in as an admin will see the users page and will even be able to search and delete users.

Users who register on the site can upload products they want to sell, update them and delete them when necessary.
Also, only registered users will be able to save products on their favorites page

Of course, you can browse the site without registering and logging in.

Happy reading and browsing :)
